I have been a Java developer since 2007.

As a Domain-Driven Design enthusiast, I am guided by the idea that software, 
by its architecture as well as its source code, should transcribe the domain with as little bias as possible, 
and that this is key to systems which are both reliable and evolutionary.

I share my passion for software craftsmanship by presentations, articles, mentoring, 
or on a more daily basis by pair programming and code reviews.
