Service Mesh is a concept that has been trending for a few years now, and for good reason, as it brings great benefits to microservice architectures...
But wait, what is this all supposed to mean?

This presentation goes back to basics  to give you a clear understanding of what a Service Mesh actually is and how it could help you in your day-to-day work.

### Architecture et documentation - ADRs (2019) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

The systems we work on are constantly evolving.
This evolution applies to their architecture as well, so documentation needs to be able to adapt.
This is the problematic Architecture Decision Records, aka ADRs, offer to tackle.

The purpose of this article is to help you understand what defines an ADR and to give you pointers as to how you can introduce this new type of documentation.
