### 2024 - BreizhCamp Rennes ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

As time goes by, most applications tend to grow heavier and heavier, until they become too expensive to maintain.

Thankfully, DDD happens to include a whole section, often overlooked, called "Supple Design". It provides techniques to reach for a design that can easily adapt to future needs. To put it simply: code that is -and will remain- a pleasure to work with.

Are these techniques from 20 years ago still relevant? How do they articulate with other concepts that have appeared since then? In order to answer these questions, let us review each of the principles of Supple Design, illustrate them in a live coding session, and see how they make sense as a whole.

### 2022 - BreizhCamp Rennes ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Service Mesh is a concept that has been trending for a few years now, and for good reason, as it brings great benefits to microservice architectures...
But wait, what is this all supposed to mean?

This presentation goes back to basics  to give you a clear understanding of what a Service Mesh actually is and how it could help you in your day-to-day work.

### 2019 - Xebicon Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Documenting architecture decisions is usually not so easy. In just 5 minutes, I give you an overview of a solution that is both lightweight and efficient: ADRs.

## Publications

### Software Craftsmanship, culture and practices (2021) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

This white paper is intended for people who have to make structuring decisions for IT and wish to benefit from the feedback of those who have already experienced the technologies of today and tomorrow.

You will find advice on all steps essential to integrate the Software Craftsmanship movement into your development process.
We hope this TechTrends will guide you in the important decisions you will have to make.

[TechTrends #4 (2nd edition)](https://click.engineering.publicissapient.fr/techtrends-craftsmanship)

### Enforcing architecture decisions with ArchUnit (2019) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

ArchUnit is a library which offers a fluent API to test the architecture of Java applications.

The 1st part of the article gives an overview of what ArchUnit is capable of.

[Blog Xebia (part 1)](https://medium.com/@sylvain.decout/appliquez-vos-d%C3%A9cisions-darchitecture-avec-archunit-1-2-5bdf97d28a89)

The 2nd part of the article questions how it can fit the way you deal with architecture and its documentation.

### Enforcing architecture decisions with ArchUnit (2019) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

ArchUnit is a library which offers a fluent API to test the architecture of Java applications.

The purpose of this article is to show what it is capable of and to question how it can fit the way you deal with architecture and its documentation.

### Architecture et documentation - ADRs (2019) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

The systems we work on evolve over time. 
This includes changes in their architecture, to which the architecture documentation must adapt.
This is the problem that Architecture Decision Records, aka ADRs, offer to tackle.

The purpose of this article is to help you understand what defines an ADR and to give you pointers as to how you can introduce this new type of documentation.
