**Sortir des ORMs avec jOOQ (2h hands-on lab)**

Hibernate, Entity Framework, JPA... We have been working with ORMs for decades.
As devs, we often know how to use them, but what's behind them is a bit of a mystery.
It's convenient, it saves time, but this magic comes with a cost that we often come to pay later on: complex queries, poor performance, context-specific behaviors...

And yet, for several years now, alternatives such as jOOQ have been gaining traction.
Their credo: throw away your ORM and go back to good old SQL, except itâ€™s type-safe.

This workshop, available in Java and Kotlin, has you working on a typical Spring / JPA application to integrate jOOQ.
We take a step-by-step approach to get rid of your harmful dependency on ORMs.
Along the way, we also discover how much simpler, more standard and more expressive our code can become.
And that it's pretty easy.

As time goes by, most applications tend to grow heavier and heavier, until they become too expensive to maintain.

Thankfully, DDD happens to include a whole section, often overlooked, called "Supple Design". It provides techniques to reach for a design that can easily adapt to future needs. To put it simply: code that is -and will remain- a pleasure to work with.

Are these techniques from 20 years ago still relevant? How do they articulate with other concepts that have appeared since then? In order to answer these questions, let us review each of the principles of Supple Design, illustrate them in a live coding session, and see how they make sense as a whole.

## 2022 - BreizhCamp Rennes ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Service Mesh is a concept that has been trending for a few years now, and for good reason, as it brings great benefits to microservice architectures...
But wait, what is this all supposed to mean?

This presentation goes back to basics  to give you a clear understanding of what a Service Mesh actually is and how it could help you in your day-to-day work.

## 2019 - Xebicon Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Documenting architecture decisions is usually not so easy. In just 5 minutes, I give you an overview of a solution that is both lightweight and efficient: ADRs.
